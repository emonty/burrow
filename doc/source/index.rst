Welcome to Burrow's documentation!
**********************************

Burrow is a message queue that can be used in a variety of
environments, from simple in-process queues to multi-tenant
cloud services. The design is extremely modular and can be
configured or extended to accommodate many use cases. For the
impatient who want to get something up and running quickly, see
:doc:`getting_started`. For a general introduction to message queues,
see the :doc:`introduction`. For an overview of how Burrow works,
see the :doc:`overview`. More detailed information and source code
documentation can be found below.

This documentation is generated by the Sphinx toolkit and lives in the
`Burrow source`_ tree. Additional documentation on Burrow and other
components of OpenStack can be found on the `OpenStack wiki`_.
